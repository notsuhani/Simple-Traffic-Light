# Simple-Traffic-Light

<h1>Traffic Light System</h1>
This project is a Traffic Light System built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It simulates the functioning of a basic traffic light with the usual colors (Red, Yellow, Green) cycling in a loop.

<h2>Demo</h2>
You can view the working demo of this traffic light system by opening the index.html file in your browser.

<h2>Features</h2>
HTML for the structure of the traffic light.

CSS for styling and adding the animations to simulate the light changes.

JavaScript to control the timing and color transitions of the traffic lights.

<h2>How It Works</h2>
The traffic light system changes colors automatically:

<h3><i>Red</i>:</h3>Stays on for a few seconds.

<h3><i>Green</i>:</h3>Lights up after Red for a few seconds.

<h3><i>Yellow</i>:</h3>Displays for a short time before transitioning back to Red.

The lights cycle in the above sequence indefinitely, simulating a real traffic light.
